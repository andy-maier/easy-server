    A vault file that specifies the sensitive portion of servers,

    An object of this class is tied to a single vault file.

    For a description of the file format, see section :ref:`Vault files`.

    The vault file may be in the encrypted or decrypted state. When data from
    the vault file is read, the vault file remains unchanged, and the data is
    is decrypted in memory if the file was in the encrypted state.

    Vault file encryption, vault file decryption, and reading data from an
    encrypted vault file requires a password specific to the vault file.
    The password can be specified as an init argument to this class, or if not
    provided will be retrieved the keyring service, or if not found there, will
    be interactively prompted for. The use of the keyring service (for
    retrieving and storing) and the use of password prompting can be
    individually disabled.

    Typical use in client programs would be to use the keyring and to specify
    no password (the default). Typical use in test programs running in a CI/CD
    system would be to specify a password (from the CI/CD system's secrets)
    and not to use the keyring.
