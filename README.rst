Overview
--------

The **easy-server** package is a Python library for securely defining
sensitive information for accessing servers (or services), such as logon
credentials or API keys.

The information for accessing the servers is divided into a general portion
that is defined in an openly accessible *server file*, and
a sensitive portion that is defined in an encrypted *vault file*.

The vault file defines the secrets needed to access the servers, such as
logon credentials or API keys. The vault file must be an "easy-vault" file and
thus can be encrypted and decrypted using the ``easy-vault`` command provided
by the `easy-vault <https://easy-vault.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ package.
The "easy-vault" files remain encrypted in the file system while their content
is used to access the servers.

The server file defines general information about the servers, such
as a short description, contact name, or a reminder which network to use for
accessing them.

The link between the server file and the vault file are user-defined
nicknames for the servers. These nicknames can also used by users as a
convenient way to identify servers in commands.

The server files support the definition of server groups that
also have a nickname.

Typical use cases for the **easy-server** package are test programs
running end-to-end tests against real servers, or command line clients that
access servers or services.

This provides a convenient, flexible and secure way how Python programs can
retrieve the secrets needed for accessing servers or services, while protecting
these secrets in a secure way.
